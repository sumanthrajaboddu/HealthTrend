# Epic List

## Epic 1: Day Card Symptom Logging
Uncle can open the app, see today's Day Card with four time slots, tap a slot, pick a severity, and it's saved locally. The core loop — the entire reason this app exists.
**FRs covered:** FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR9, FR17

## Epic 2: Day Navigation & History
Uncle can swipe between days, use the week strip to jump to any day, and log retroactively for missed slots — all with the exact same tap-to-log flow.
**FRs covered:** FR10, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR15, FR16

## Epic 3: App Configuration & Google Sheets Sync
Raja sets up the app — signs in with Google, pastes the Sheet URL, enters Uncle's name. Data syncs silently to Google Sheets so Raja can monitor from anywhere.
**FRs covered:** FR18, FR19, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR39, FR40, FR41, FR42, FR43, FR44

## Epic 4: Notification Reminders
Uncle gets a gentle buzz at each time slot reminding him to log — one notification, no follow-up, no guilt. Reminders survive device restarts.
**FRs covered:** FR31, FR32, FR33, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR37, FR38

## Epic 5: Analytics & Trends
Uncle opens the Analytics tab and sees how his symptoms have changed over time — trend chart, time-of-day breakdown, date range selection.
**FRs covered:** FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26

## Epic 6: PDF Report & Sharing
Uncle taps Export, generates a clean PDF with his name, the trend chart, time-of-day summary, and a daily log table — then shares it with the doctor via WhatsApp.
**FRs covered:** FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30
