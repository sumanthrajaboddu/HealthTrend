# Architecture Completion Summary

## Workflow Completion

**Architecture Decision Workflow:** COMPLETED
**Total Steps Completed:** 8
**Date Completed:** 2026-02-07
**Document Location:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`

## Final Architecture Deliverables

**Complete Architecture Document:**
- All architectural decisions documented with specific, web-verified versions
- Implementation patterns ensuring AI agent consistency
- Complete project structure with 40+ files and exact package paths
- Requirements to architecture mapping (44 FRs + 29 NFRs → specific files)
- Validation confirming coherence and completeness

**Implementation Ready Foundation:**
- 15 architectural decisions made across 5 categories
- 18 implementation pattern conflict points addressed with 7 mandatory enforcement rules
- ~12 architectural components specified across 3 screens + data/sync/notification layers
- 73 requirements (44 FR + 29 NFR) fully supported

**AI Agent Implementation Guide:**
- Technology stack with verified current versions (AGP 9.0, Compose BOM 2025.12.00, Room 2.8.4, etc.)
- Consistency rules preventing implementation conflicts
- Project structure with clear boundaries and data flow diagrams
- Severity and TimeSlot enums as single source of truth

## Architecture Status: READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

**Next Phase:** Begin implementation using the architectural decisions and patterns documented herein.

**Document Maintenance:** Update this architecture when major technical decisions are made during implementation.
